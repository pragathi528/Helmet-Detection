# Helmet-Detection
Using Keras and TensorFlow to train a classifier to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a helmet or not by fine-tuning the MobileNet V2 architecture.

#Overview
This is a simple image classification project trained on the top of Keras/Tensorflow API with MobileNetV2 deep neural network architecture having weights considered as pre-trained 'imagenet' weights. The trained model (helmet.model) takes the real-time video from webcam as an input is 'Helmet' or 'No Helmet' with real-time on screen accuracy.
